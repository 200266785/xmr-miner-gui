# XMR miner GUI
Simply mine Monero (XMR) with your CPU controlled via a graphical user interface.

Use the Github issues to report any problems and include the terminal output of `uname -a`.  
Your feedback and ideas are very appreciated.

*Note: currently limited to CPU mining, but IÂ´m working on GPU mining support.*

Good mining,
